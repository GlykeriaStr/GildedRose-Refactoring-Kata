# Gilded Rose Tech test

This test is for practicing OO design, TDD skills, refactoring as well as producing a clean code.

## Planning

* As I knew that I couldn't change the Item class, my first move was to remove it from the file and have it on a separate one.
* I wrote down all the specifications about each item that needed attention as well as the overall requirements.

* After making sure I understood the requirements, I started my TDD process making sure I test everything and break down the class into small methods.

## Coverage
 * 15 examples, all passing, 100% coverage.
